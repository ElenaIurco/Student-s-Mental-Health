# Student's Mental Health (Japan)

Welcome to the "Student's Mental Health" database project! 

Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.

In this project, I'm exploring the students data using PostgreSQL to find out if I come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.

## Use of SQL

The project has a collection of SQL queries to demonstrate how to retrieve information from the database. These queries cover common use cases, such as retrieving overall mental health statistics, identifying high-risk students, and generating reports.

## Contribution
Contributions to enhance the database schema, optimize queries, or improve documentation are welcome!
